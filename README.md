# Machine-Learning-Tutorials

This tutorial is for beginners in Machine Learning. When I studied Machine Learning, I found lack of comphrehensive tutorials availiable online.This is an effort to help the students who are interested in machine learning or have a class/course in Machine Learning in school.<br>

The tutorials assume you have your machine learning environment set up already in R or python.<br>

The tutorial covers the following topics which improve your concepts in machine learning and provide some hands on experience to write simple programs in R and python.<br>

# Classification:
Examples of Classification algorithms in R and Python<br>
Dataset used: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data

# Clustering:

# Feature Engineering techniques to improve performance of your predictive models:
Principal Component Analysis( Dimensionality Reduction )<br>
Reduction in levels of Categorical Variables<br>
Binning/Converting Numerical to Categorical variables<br>
Standardizing or scaling numerical variables<br>
Use of dummy variables<br>

# Trivia about Machine learning algorithms ( which algorithm to use when)
